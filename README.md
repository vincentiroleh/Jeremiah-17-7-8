# THERE MUST BE SOMETHING IN THE WATER – JEREMIAH 17:7-8


Jeremiah 17:7-8 (NASB): “Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord And whose trust is the Lord. “For he will be like a tree planted by the water, That extends its roots by a stream And will not fear when the heat comes; But its leaves will be green, And it will not be anxious in a year of drought Nor cease to yield fruit.


The first thing that jumps out to me is that this blessed man not only trusts in the Lord, but his trust IS the Lord. That’s a whole extra level, don’t you think?

An extra level that will not be anxious in a year of drought, nor cease to yield fruit!


## How can we get to that level?

Glad you asked.

This is an easy one because these verses tell us exactly how to get there.

1. Plant yourself by the water.
2. Extend your roots by a stream.

## There must be something in the water!

What’s in it?

Let’s check a couple of cross references.

```Psalm 1:2-3 (CSB): Instead, his delight is in the LORD’s instruction, and he meditates on it day and night. He is like a tree planted beside flowing streams that bears its fruit in its season and whose leaf does not wither. Whatever he does prospers.```

Takeaway: Planted by flowing streams = meditating on the Lord’s instruction. Day and night, I might add.

So, what’s in this water – to get us to that extra level of trust?

Spending time in God’s Word. And probably lots of time.

I know. I know. Time is hard to come by.


## Would you find the time if the doctor prescribed it for your anxiety?

I’m thinking yes.

So why is the Bible the last thing we try during the heat of anxiety?

And why don’t we use this prescription every day to prevent a flair up?

We could stop right there and ponder that for a long time … but there’s more.


Here’s another cross reference …

```Psalm 36:7-8 (CSB): How priceless your faithful love is, God! People take refuge in the shadow of your wings. They are filled from the abundance of your house. You let them drink from your refreshing stream.```

Takeaway: Refreshing stream -> for those who take refuge in the Lord.


## So back to our question … what’s in this water – to get us to that extra level of trust?

Taking refuge in the Lord.

And how does it tell us to take refuge in the Lord?

1. Fill ourselves from the abundance of His house.
2. Drink from His refreshing stream.

Where can we drink to fill ourselves? The Word. (You knew it was coming.)

When we spend time in His Word, we find God Himself.

```John 1:1 (ESV): In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.```

“The Word” (Strong’s 3056) in this verse is a bit complicated – it means: the essential Word of God, i. e. the personal (hypostatic) wisdom and power in union with God; Christ, expressing the thoughts of the Father through the Spirit.


On the one hand it’s complicated, but on the other it’s not. If you’d like a tangible place to take refuge, you got it.

His Word. In the Word, we find Him – and therefore, the shadow of His wings to take refuge.


## And it’s the place that will take us to the extra level.

Where our trust IS the Lord.

```Psalm 42:1 (ESV): As a deer pants for flowing streams, so pants my soul for you, O God.```

## Let us pray

Lord, through this word, inspire us to open our Bible and dig deeper to write God’s Word in our hearts.
